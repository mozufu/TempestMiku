# 9. Context & artifact management

- Outputs above the per-cell cap are **content-addressed** and stored; the model receives
  `artifact://<id>`, a MIME type, a size, and a short preview.
- The model re-reads on demand: `artifacts.slice(id, start, end)` — paged, never the whole blob.
- Artifacts are referenceable across cells and persist for the session (optionally the workspace).
- This is the mechanism that keeps a 2 MB fetch from ever entering the window: it lands in the
  store, the code works on it in-sandbox, and only `display(summary)` reaches context.
